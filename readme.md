## What is this?

A fun party game, where you must find your match in a crowd, as quick as possible! You will only have a color to work with, and you need to verify your match with a sound.

Put your phone up to your partners, one of you press the record button, and the other play the sound!

## Game controls?

Yes! there's an admin panel at /admin.html (it's extremely insecure & has a hard-set password in multiplace places :skull:)

It lets you manage the game, start the game, and refresh data

## What tech?

websockets! + express server
